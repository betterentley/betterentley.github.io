Hi! My name is John and this is my personal blog. I created this site to showcase my personal data science and engineering projects, though I hope to also post life updates and thoughts on interesting books I've read from time to time. I created this site with the "Clean Blog" Jekyll theme.

I'm currently looking for a position in the field of data science. I am skilled in machine learning, financial and scientific modeling, statistical analysis, leadership, and communication with team members and clients. I've worked for the Yale Department of Political Science (researching the economic cost of nuclear weapons acquisition), NASA (developing algorithms to detect magnetohydrodynamic waves for the GOES satellites), and BRF (providing financial advice to ultra high-net-worth individuals). I'm excited about any project that offers the potential to generate positive social impact by applying cutting edge modeling and analytical solutions.
